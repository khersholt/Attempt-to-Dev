	<h1>I Love You, Viv!</h1>

	<h3>I'm Your BIGGEST Fan</h3>
	
<p>I mean... where do I even begin? Before I met you, I was lonely as hell. I didn't ever think I'd find love again, let alone this ridiculous level of gross-love that I've stumbled upon. Like, I didn’t even think this was possible. Seriously, has anyone ever loved another person as much as I love you? I HIGHLY doubt it.</p>

	<h4>I Want, Need, Lust, and Love Your Everything</h4>

<p>Your smile stops me in my tracks. Your laugh makes my insides all warm and tingly. Your kisses make me meltier than vegan butter on a piece of hot toast. Your friendship and partnership has completely restored my faith in humanity. You make me want to be 100x better than I once thought was possible. You make me want to save the world, one kiss, one avocado, and one mushroom at a time.</p>

	<h4>All You Have to Do is Ask</h4>

<p>Viv, I just think you’re the coolest. I can’t wait to see you tonight, tomorrow night, the night after that, this weekend, next month, next year, and all the years after, for infinity and beyond. Promise me that you’ll never stop loving me, and I’ll reward you with shoulder rubs, green tea in the morning, avocado toast on-demand, and all the under-the-covers action you could possibly ask for.</p>

<p>Keep smiling baby, it seriously makes me the happiest guy in the whole world.</p>

<h2>I LOVE YOU!!!</h2>
